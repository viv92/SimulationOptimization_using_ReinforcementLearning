find the setting closest to our problem and use their update regime. Possible settings are:
1. average reward (mahadevan paper)
2. elevator (barto paper)
3. policy gradient in smdp


a. per truck smdp update
b. reward = -1 * time of truck cycle
c. td_target = reward + df * value of cur state
d. td_error = td_target - value of old state for this truck 
e. try df=1
